    <p>Instructions: Press on the four buttons above and watch the face change to display the emotion indicated on the button and reset to send the face back to a neutral face. Clicking on a new face will delete any modifications that have been made through other means (see below) <br> <br> Click on the chin on any of the faces to draw a beard. This can be repeated to create a thicker beard. <br> <br> Click on the eyes when they are round (either on the neutral face, the surprised face, or the sad face) to make it wink. You can do this to both of the eyes to make it close both eyes.<br> <br> Click on the mouth of the frightened face to hear a scream (Make sure your sound is turned on!) <br> <br> &copy; Robbie Thandi 2017</p>
